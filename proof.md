Assumption:
Assume that √2 is rational. Then there exists a pair of positive integers a and b in lowest terms such that,
√2 = a/b ⇒ a = √2b
squaring both sides: a² = 2b²
Now, instead of thinking about this completely algebraically or in 2 dimensions, we introduce a third dimension, height y, to visualize 
this equation as the volumes of cuboids.
We let the length and the breadth of the cuboids be equal.
