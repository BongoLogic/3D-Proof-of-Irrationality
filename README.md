This "proof," if you even call it that, was based on the 2D proof of irrationality using the carpet's theorem. 
Carpets Theorem states that if two carpets perfectly tile a plane, and the carpets are laid irregularly such that they overlap, leaving some uncovered region on that plane, then the area of the uncovered region will be equal to the area of overlap.

I got to know about this proof from a kind man on reddit, who posts beautiful, pure geometrical proofs of different Integrals.
I didn't understand much of it but still reached out to him about, how I can do proofs like he does and told him that the only proof I had ever done was of irrationality that is taught in most school math textbooks.
But instead of naming books or concepts to overwhelm me, he sent me the link to that video mentioned above and wanted me to watch that proof.
So that is when I thought that if there is geometrical 2D proof then why not build one on the same principle but in 3D.

I was on a trip a few weeks ago when I started to think about the idea. The method you see in the "proof" seems incredibly easy and of no use, but coming up with it took me more than a week, and doesn't look obvious at all, when you see how simple and almost no work is involved in my "proof."

I started by combining and overlaping multible cubes inside a bigger cube in the hopes of achieving a self repeating pattern. I tried with 2 cubes and then 3 cubes and then I thought, maybe the amount you need is half o the verticies, like 2 small squares for a sqares, which has 4 vertices so maybe I needed 4 smaller cubes to make a self repeating pattern.

nothing seemed to be working and I was thinking of stuff like "hmmm a sqare has 4 vertices that is 2 squared and the diagonal is √2. And a cube has 8 vertices that is 2 cubed and the diagonal is ∛2.............so a 4D cube (tesseract) has 16 vertices that is 2⁴ so it's diagonal must be ∜2 and so on"

I had given up on finding a self repeating pattern in cubes that could work but while thinking about it, I knew that cuboids do have such a pattern but I wasn't convinced that I could not find a "proof" using cuoids.

But I decided to work on it algerbraically and found a pattern while calculating the volume of a cuboid having a square base.

One thing that was interesting to see is that in both the 2D and the 3D approach, you find a ratio of 3/4 when you simplify the eqaution and take the ratio one the sides of the bigger square/cube and the smaller square/cube, and why does this ratio come up in the volume formula of a sphere?
